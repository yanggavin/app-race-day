        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Race Countdown (the “App”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what
          information we do and do not collect, how any information may be used,
          and your rights. If anything here conflicts with your expectations,
          please contact us so we can address it promptly.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          By default, the App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit
          personal information. The App processes data locally on your device and
          does not include advertising or third‑party analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to contact us for support, we may receive your email and
          the content of your message. We use this information solely to respond
          to your inquiry.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Crash Reporting and Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>
          Apple may provide anonymized crash logs and diagnostics if you have
          opted in to share analytics with developers in iOS settings. We use
          these reports only to improve stability and performance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>
          App data is stored on your device. We do not operate our own backend
          service for this App. If you contact support, related emails are
          retained only as long as necessary to address your request.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sharing and Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information. We do not
          transfer data to third parties, except as required by law.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly
          collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has
          provided personal information, please contact us to remove it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct,
          or delete personal information. Since the App does not collect personal
          data, most requests will apply only to communications you send us.
          Contact us and we will assist.
